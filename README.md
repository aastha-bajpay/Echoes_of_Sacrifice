### üí° The Concept

In a world saturated with games that empower the player, **Echoes of Sacrifice** explores the opposite. It's a game built on a single, powerful premise: **What if progress required you to become weaker?**

You are a lone entity in an unseen labyrinth. The walls are invisible, the path is unknown, and your only guide is the faint memory of light. To earn a fleeting glimpse of your surroundings, you must permanently sacrifice one of your core abilities‚Äîthe very controls you use to navigate.

This isn't just a story about sacrifice; the theme is the central game mechanic. Each level becomes a tense negotiation with yourself: which ability can you afford to lose? The path to victory is paved with the ghosts of your own abandoned powers.

### üïπÔ∏è How to Play

The rules are simple, but the choices are hard.

1.  **The Goal:** Navigate the **red square** (you) to the **green square** (the exit).
2.  **The Darkness:** The maze walls are invisible. You have to feel your way through or risk getting lost.
3.  **The Altars:** The **blue squares** are Altars of Sacrifice. Moving onto one will pause the game.
4.  **The Sacrifice:** To proceed, you must choose a movement key (Up, Down, Left, or Right) to sacrifice forever.
5.  **The Revelation:** Upon making a sacrifice, the entire maze is revealed for a few precious seconds. **Memorize the path.**
6.  **The Challenge:** Reach the exit with your limited movement before you trap yourself.

At the very start of the game, the map is revealed for **5 seconds** to give you a fighting chance. Use it wisely!

### ‚ú® Why It Stands Out

*   **Core Mechanic as the Theme:** We didn't just add a story about sacrifice. The act of giving up control *is* the game. This creates a direct, tangible connection between the player's actions and the game's narrative theme.
*   **Minimalist by Design:** The stark, high-contrast aesthetic (black, white, and primary colors) is a deliberate choice. It focuses the player's attention entirely on the light/dark mechanic and the tension of navigating an unseen space.
*   **Player-Driven Difficulty:** The game doesn't get harder on its own. The player actively makes it harder for themselves with every sacrifice, leading to a unique and personal difficulty curve for every playthrough.
*   **Zero-Dependency Build:** Built with pure, vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It's lightweight, runs in any modern browser, and has no external dependencies, showcasing foundational web development skills.

### üíª Tech Stack

*   **Frontend:** HTML5
*   **Styling:** CSS3
*   **Logic:** Vanilla JavaScript (ES6)
